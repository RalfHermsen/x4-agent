"""Translates validated planner actions into commands the in-game bridge accepts.

This is the last layer before anything reaches the game, and it is deliberately
narrow. Three separate gates stand between a model's idea and your empire:

1. `planner.check_actions()` already dropped actions referring to things that do
   not exist or are not ours.
2. This module only translates action types that the Mission Director side can
   actually execute. Everything else stays advice, no matter how confident the
   model was.
3. The caller decides whether to send at all (advise vs execute mode).

The executable vocabulary grows only when the matching MD command has been
written and verified. Today that is one entry.

Usage:
    from executor import to_commands
    commands, skipped = to_commands(validated_actions)
